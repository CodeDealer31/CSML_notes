# UCL MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning

Here are my revision notes for this degree. Understanding and learning these summary notes alone got me a distinction in my exams, so hopefully they're mostly correct and somewhat thorough. These notes are definitely not perfect and messily hand written, but maybe someone will find something useful.

### Structure
The general structure of my notes is *Overview*, *Summary*, *Notes* (each more detailed than the previous). Some modules may be missing the overview and/or summary if I decided it wasn't necessary.

### Module Contents
* **COMPGI01 Supervised Learning**: Theory behind lots of what you'll find in scikit-learn.
* **COMPGI09 Applied ML**: Actually not so applied. Overview of some Supervised and Unsupervised Learning approaches and optimisation.
* **COMPGI13 Advanced ML**: Covers deep learning and reinforcement learning. Each half can be treated independently.
* **COMPGI18 Probabilistic & Unsupervised Learning**: Basic Bayes, Latent Variables, Expectation Maximisation, Graphical Models and Gaussian Processes.
* **STATG001 Statistical Models & Data Analysis**: Crash course in classical statistics.
* **STATG004 Bayesian Stats**: Introduction to Bayesian statistics.
* **STATG017 Stochastic Finance 1**: Derivative pricing, Stochastic Calculus, Black Scholes, The Greeks.
* **STATG020 Stochastic Finance 2**: Market Risk, Credit Risk, Asset pricing techniques
